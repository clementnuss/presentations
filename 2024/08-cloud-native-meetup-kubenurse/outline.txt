# Introduction

# Randomness

in the context of theoretical computer science, servers/computers can be
considered as a practical realization of random (access) machines

in the context of applied systems engineering (or platform engineering, DevOps,
DevSecOps, NetOps, SysOps), servers can be observed to behave randomly



# Kubenurse



# Example: ESXi host with latency issues

# Demo - installing Kubenurse

# Demo - introducing some chaos on random nodes, monitoring the effect with kubenurse

# Conclusion / Call to Action
